# Dautonav
Simple utility to navigate in Dofus with a keyboard.

## How to use
### Installation
1. Dowload the [latest release](https://github.com/Meknassih/dautonav/releases/latest);
2. Unzip it wherever you want.

### First run
1. Bring up the game window at the foreground;
2. Run `main.exe`;
3. Configure the clicking zones by going up, right, down then left (in this order) in the game;
4. All done ! Use the arrow keys to move instead of the mouse.

### Subsequent runs
1. Run `main.exe`;
2. Bring up the game window at the foreground;
3. Use the arrow keys to move instead of the mouse.

## Tips
- Your character doesnâ€™t need to actually change maps for step 5 to work because it uses the coordinates of your mouse.
- The configuration step (5) is only done once then saved to disk for future usage. You can delete `config.json` to start from scratch.
